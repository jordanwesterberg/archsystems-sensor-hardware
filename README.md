Created to measure the use patterns of income generating appliances powered by diesel engines in developing economies

These data generated by these sensors will help transition these appliances from being powered by diesel fuel to renewable energy.
The assembly can be used to log usage by measuring the RPM on the engine by counting the rotations of a magnet mounted to the appliance’s pulley wheel.
The housing head protects an (indepedently sourced) PCB board and reed switch that actively counts the magnet’s reps and stores the data in the Arch Pod (from Arch Systems) below it.
The information is transmitted to a cloud database via smartphone app and Bluetooth low energy.
The assembly was built around the existing Arch Systems Pod (https://archsys.io/) and designed to measure RPM accurately over many different use cases.
The armatures that connect the housing head and Pod cap can be easily adjusted with minimal hardware to fit the needs of many different height requirements and distances from the appliance’s pulley wheel.
